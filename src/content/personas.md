## Overview

Figma is the newest industry standard tool for designers of all kinds who work on web and mobile projects. As such, its interface is thoughtfully crafted as to give users an experience worth aspiring to create in their own projects.


I took a look at Figma's Layers Panel to see if there were any ways to improve an already excellent platform. It turns out that there is a great opportunity for improvement when comparing the nested accordion that Figma uses with other similar components used by commonplace applications.

## Observations

Before talking to vending machine users, I observed that

- Users of the vending machine often check the prices before providing a method of payment.
- Users who do not check the prices spend little time deciding what to buy before they pay.
- Most users use a credit or debit card to pay for their snack.
- Users act more quickly when other people are waiting to use the machine
- Users will often either eat their snack next to the vending machine or promptly leave the room

## INTERVIEWing

I rooted my interviews in the following 5 questions:

1. *Why did you use this particular vending machine today?*

User A said this. User B said this. User C said this.

2. ***How often do you use vending machine on campus?***

Rather than asking about this specific vending machine, I asked about machines on campus because they provide a similar user experience.

3. **How would you describe the process of selecting an item?**

4. Were there any points where you hesitated or were unsure about what to do next?

5. Is there anything you wish the vending machine did differently to improve your experience?


## Defining users

- include the sound feedback in the storyboard
- include the retry for vending when the object doesn't hit the floor


## Conclusions
